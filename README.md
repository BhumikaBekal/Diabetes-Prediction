The goal of the project is to see how accurately we can predict whether a given patient has diabetes or not. The dataset consists of some medical distinct variables, such as pregnancy record, BMI, insulin level, age, glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, diabetes pedigree function etc. This dataset has 768 patientâ€™s data where all the patients are female and at least 21 years old. The number of true cases are 268 (34.90%) and the number of false cases are 500 (65.10%), respectively, in the dataset. I used the classification technique Support Vector Machine (SVM)
